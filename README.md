# expense_analysis

This project analyzes my personal expenses and income data using Python and SQLite. The goal was to track financial trends over time, understand spending habits, and improve budgeting.

Key tools and libraries:

- SQLite for structured data storage and querying

- Pandas for data manipulation

- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

This project helped me build a clearer picture of my finances while practicing SQL joins, filtering, aggregations, and Python-based analysis and charting.

Note: For privacy reasons, no personal financial data is shared in this repository.
